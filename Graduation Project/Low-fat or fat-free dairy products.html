                        However, a report published by the Review of Food Science and Technology confirms that the percentage of fat in these materials is very low, but they contain high carbohydrates. For example, 240 grams of non-fat flavored yogurt contains 47 grams of sugar,
                        which is approximately 12 teaspoons of sugar, which is the daily amount that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends not exceeding for an adult of normal weight, while one serving of The equivalent of chocolate pudding contains
                        38 grams of sugar.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The report also revealed, on the one hand, that eating skim or low-fat dairy products does not enhance the feeling of fullness, which may make you eat larger amounts of food from different sources throughout the day, and thus consume more calories.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        It is known that dairy products are considered a good source of calcium and a group of fat-soluble vitamins, such as: A, D, E, and K, but this does not apply to skimmed products in which these vitamins are absent, including vitamin D, which helps... Absorption
                        of calcium, which prevents it from being absorbed and used by the body. The importance of calcium for humans does not stop at bones and teeth, as some studies (including research published in the journal Nutrients) indicate that
                        dietary or supplemental calcium may help lose weight in children, women, and men with diabetes.

                    <li>
                        Contrary to popular belief, recent studies have shown that consuming full-fat dairy products is associated with a lower likelihood of gaining weight over the years, and reduces body fat. The reason for this is that fat is a satiating nutrient, and eating
                        it slows the release of sugars into the bloodstream, which increases the feeling of fullness, and thus helps you not overeat and consume fewer calories throughout the day.

                    <li>
                        Dairy fats contain the unsaturated fatty acid linoleic (CLA), which helps reduce body fat and inflammation, reduce and improve blood sugar control, and fight cancer cells. The American Society for Clinical Nutrition also showed that fermented dairy products,
                        such as: yogurt and whole cheese Fat does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, as consuming full-fat cheese leads to raising the level of healthy cholesterol (HDL), which is linked to a lower risk of heart disease at
                        a higher rate than consuming low-fat varieties.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fat also holds good news for people who are sensitive to lactose, as full-fat dairy products also contain a lower percentage of lactose than low-fat ones, and are therefore digested better by those who are lactose intolerant or sensitive.

                        In conclusion, some details must be taken into consideration to deal with fats in diets. For example, food labels must be read carefully, and focus not only on the percentage of fat, but also on the percentage of sugar. Here, it is recommended to choose
                        dairy products that contain the lowest percentage of sugar.
