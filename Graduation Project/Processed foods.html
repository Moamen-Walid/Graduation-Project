                        <h5>Processed foods :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Processed foods are any foods that have been modified before being eaten, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. This means that foods such as packaged spinach can be considered processed, as its green leaves are cut and washed before they
                    reach the kitchen. There are other processed foods, such as pasta sauces that are sold in jars. , to which preservatives and spices are added, and frozen foods that are prepared in the microwave. These foods are considered manufactured
                    because they were previously prepared and some materials were added to them, but when nutritionists refer to manufactured foods, they mean foods that are greatly modified, and that contain many ingredients, It should be noted that
                    there are many foods that fall under the list of processed foods, some of which we will mention later in this article. In fact, these foods contain little nutritional value, and therefore limiting their intake is beneficial for health.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Harmful effects of processed foods :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are many reasons why processed foods are harmful to health, including the following :-</p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>High in sugar and high fructose corn syrup :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Foods and drinks are among the richest sources of added sugar, and sugar is very harmful to health, and if it is consumed in excess; It can lead to serious negative effects on metabolism.</p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Manufactured in a way that leads to excessive consumption :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Food factories add huge amounts of substances that will make the brain love them as much as possible, which leads to excessive consumption.</p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>It contains many artificial ingredients :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In fact, most processed foods contain many artificial ingredients, including flavors, textures, dyes, and preservatives.</p>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Possibility of causing addiction :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is believed that unhealthy food affects the biochemistry of the brain in some people, leading to their addiction to it, and thus these people will lose control over their eating of it.</p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Rich in refined carbohydrates :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The carbohydrates found in processed foods are mostly refined, and eating them leads to a random rise in blood sugar and insulin levels, which negatively affects health.</p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Low in nutrients :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are many nutrients found in whole foods that cannot be found in processed foods. The more processed foods a person eats, the less beneficial nutrients he gets from food.</p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Low fiber :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <P>Soluble and fermentable fibers have many health benefits, but most processed foods lack these fibers, because they are lost during manufacturing processes.</P>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Some types of processed foods :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are many processed foods that it is recommended to avoid or reduce their intake, and among these foods we mention the following :-</p>




                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Flavored nuts :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Sugar or salt is added to most types of flavored nuts, which may cause weight gain, diabetes, and high blood pressure, in addition to the sweet flavor in them may cause harm to the teeth, and instead it is recommended to eat unflavored
                    nuts.
                </p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Microwave popcorn :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In fact, the harm coming from it is due to the bag in which it is placed, as it is made of many chemicals, including a substance called (in English: Perfluoroalkyls), and this substance may cause many health problems, and instead you can
                    eat popcorn prepared at home.</p>




                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Dried fruits :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Although dried fruits are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, one must be careful not to eat them, as a small amount of them contains a large amount of calories and sugar, which may cause weight gain, and if one eats a larger amount
                    than the body needs, it may be stored. The body is in the form of fat.</p>



                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Vegetable ghee :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Ghee is rich in trans fats. These fats are considered the most harmful fats, as they increase levels of harmful cholesterol in the blood, which increases the risk of strokes or heart disease. You can eat mashed avocado, nut milk, or yogurt
                    instead of ghee.</p>




                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Ketchup :</h5>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>As a small bag of ketchup contains approximately two grams of sugar, tomato paste can be used instead.</p>
