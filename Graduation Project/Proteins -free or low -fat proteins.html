                        The Proteins are the building blocks of the body and are vital macronutrients for maintaining and repairing tissues, cells, and organs. Despite its presence in the foods we eat every day, many of us still fall short of consuming the required amount. By
                        understanding what lean protein is best, an individual can increase their protein intake without worrying about excess fat.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        When ingested, the body breaks down protein into 20 amino acids necessary for growth. Many protein sources, whether eggs, meat, poultry, fish, or meat, contain all the amino acids that the body needs. Protein sources such as: moisture, grains, beans,
                        and nuts are often sourced to one or more essential amino compositions. However, this does not mean that animal protein is a must. Protein can be increased by including a variety of plant sources.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adults should eat at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. While breastfeeding women should aim to get about 20 grams more of high-quality protein per day than before pregnancy to support lactation, older adults should aim for
                        1 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of weight.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Checking the types and quality of protein before consuming it is crucial. For example, both red meat and full-fat dairy products are rich in protein, but contain saturated fat.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One way to identify the best protein sources is to examine meat that is industrially raised with high-quality ex-grass-fed organic meat. You should always choose high-quality sources when trying to increase your protein intake.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    1– Legumes, beans, and lentils are low-fat sources of protein and other nutrients. It does not provide all the amino acids or protein components that the body needs. However, several types of grains can be combined to provide the body with the required
                    amino acids.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2- Chicken breasts, turkey, oysters, and most types of fish are excellent sources of protein. Removing the skin from these sources reduces the fat content significantly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3- Choose seafood three times a week, because it is rich in protein and low in saturated fat. Salmon, sardines, anchovies and herring are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    5- Choose the best cooking methods, such as grilling, boiling, or steaming, to reduce fat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    6- Processed meats are a good source of protein, but they are often loaded with salt. This can lead to high blood pressure and other health problems. Therefore it should be avoided.
                </p>

                <P>
                    7- Skip processed cheese because it often contains non-dairy ingredients.
                </P>

                <p>
                    8- Snack on nuts and seeds instead of chips, replace baked goods with Greek yogurt, or replace pizza slices with grilled chicken breast and beans. Always choose unsalted nuts and seeds to reduce your sodium intake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    9- Tofu (a type of cheese) can help you meet your protein needs and does not contain a lot of fat.
                </p>


                <p>

                </p>


                <p>
                    11- Adding vegetables such as spinach, peas, and mushrooms increases the protein content. They are also fat-free and rich in good fibre, making them a great addition to your meals.
                </p>


                <p>
                    12- Increase protein in your diet by replacing processed carbohydrates with high-quality protein. Avoid cakes, pastries, biscuits, chips and pizza and replace them with white meat, fish, beans, nuts, seeds, peas, dairy products and tofu. This will help
                    you maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.
